# SocialNetworkAnalysis
This is the final project for the course: social network analysis. I analyze a university department network to give suggestions on how to select representatives and promote diversity etc.

#This project includes calculating Mean recurrence time of a markov chain following "Analysis of Markov Influence Graphs" by Joost Berkhout and Bernd Heidergott.
